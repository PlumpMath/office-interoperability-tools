The source was modified in order to support one additional fileÂ type -
unfortunately the modified source version was lost :(

These dlls were probably copied from the net, they are available at various
places: 
ExcelApi.dll
NetOffice.dll
OfficeApi.dll
PowerPointApi.dll
VBIDEApi.dll
WordApi.dll

Instalation and testing:

Copy everything to some place in Windows. If using Wine to run MSOffice
(tested with 2010),  copy them to .wineprefixes/msoffice2010/drive_c/windows/
(or similar).

Then, run:
On Windows (using the Cygwin bash shell, byt maybe also using cmd):
$ path_to/OfficeConvert.exe --list
On Linux :
wine .wineprefixes/msoffice2010/drive_c/windows/OfficeConvert.exe --list 2>/dev/null

If you can see the following, everything is OK
