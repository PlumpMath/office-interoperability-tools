Content of the directory:

the subdirectories bullets, formatting,... contain:
	- source documents (eg. bullets/LO41/bullets-LO41.odt), 
	- converted documents (eg. bullets/LO41/bullets-LO41.docx) and 
	- printed documents (eg. bullets/LO41/bullets-LO41.odt.MS13.pdf). 
The source documents were created manually, conversion was done by 'dogenall.sh -c' and printing by 'dogenall.sh -p)

The subdirectory 'pdfpairs' contains pair views of the printed source document and printed converted document and were produced by the 'doviews.sh' script
For example, pair:a:l:200-bullets-LO41-odt-MS13.pdf displays a pair created from 
the printed source bullets/LO41/bullets-LO41.odt.LO41.pdf and 
the printed converted document bullets/LO41/bullets-LO41.odt.MS13.pdf
In the name 
	a: means that the file is annotated, 
	l: means that 'doviews -l' was used (page overlay)
	g: means that 'doviews -g' was used (line overlay) and 
	200 (dpi) means the used resolution. 
Except for the files in pdfpair the 'doviews.sh' script produced the pdf and csv files in this directory:
	all-l* by running 'doviews -l -p -o all-l'
	all-g* by running 'doviews -g -p -o all-g'
The all-l*.csv and all-g*.csv contain the same except for different names of pair files in the pdfpair directory (l: and g:)
These pdfs contain pair views for the given case

The odt reports were created by the 'summaries.sh' script, which call 'doeval.sh'. all-l*odf and all-g*.odt contain identical numeric values, they differ only in links to the pair pdf fime in the pdfpair directory.
